# cryptage
**Try to code a program for cryptage in sha256 python**


*You need python 3.8 + Visual studio code or PyCharm like idle.*

You do not need a third party extension to run the program.

***But if that doesn't work try reinstalling python or installing hashlib***

[hashlib](https://pypi.org/project/hashlib/)


````pip install hashlib````
